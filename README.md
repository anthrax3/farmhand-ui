# Farmhand UI

The UI companion to [Farmhand](https://github.com/b-ryan/farmhand). Farmhand UI
is a web interface that shows you lists of pending, completed, and failed jobs.
You can use it to get details of a job, including when it was queued, the
results of the job, or why it failed. In addition, failed jobs can be re-queued
right from the UI.
